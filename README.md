# weather-watch

Thank you for checking out my Weather page.
This was a challenging and fun assignment.  I was able to do much of it on my own, starting to really put the pieces of the classes and modules together!

I used bulma.io for much of my styling, this was practice for the group project in which we have to use a styling software other than Bootstrap.

I had difficulty finding an api that met all of the criteria so I don't have wind and humidity but I was excited to put in 2 apis: 1 for grabbing the location key of the city and then putting that into the 2nd api to get weather info for that city.
